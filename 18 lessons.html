Welcome to the new year! A fresh start, a new beginning, 365 more pages to fill with whatever you want. For me, the new year is something I always get excited for. How could you not? It seems like everyone has set the reset button and is ready to be their best selves (or for at least a little while).

The new year also means a new birthday, a new year for you to restart. Mine is in January was always fun, I felt like I followed the new year. Almost like new age, new me.

18 was alright. There were moments of doubt and failure and there were moments of great success and achievement. I feel 18 taught me more than I had ever learned from a year before. Here are 18 lessons that 18 years have taught me.
<p>
1. Life is a lot more fun with a "why not" attitude

Buy those concert tickets, apply to that thing, dye your hair. Create memories and experiences to look back on with no rhyme or reason.
</p>
<P>
2. The power you hold is far more than you think

Life is crazy and sometimes you get stuck going with the flow. Your voice means something. You're so powerful in terms of your life.
</P>
<P>
3. To hold a grudge is a waste of everyone's time

A lot of people will wrong you in your life, do things you never thought they would do, act in ways you never thought they would act. Sometimes you just have to say "you won" and move on.
</P>
<P>
4. Keep in touch with people

Never underestimate the power of a call to your best friend, grandmother, or parents.
</P>
<P>
5. Some people have expiration dates

I spent a lot of my year trying to get away from people who did not demonstrate what I want in my life. Some goodbyes were harder than others, but my life, in the end, was far better.
</P>
<p>
    6. Live for the experiences

I realized this later in the year, but live for the things you might not be able to do again. Go to that sports game, go to the concert, start a new hobby. Trust me Netflix, Hulu and YouTube will all be there when you get back.
</p>
<P>
7. Never settle

If 2018 taught me nothing else it taught me what I deserved. It taught me to be the best I can be and to expect that from the people around me. Never settle, there are amazing people out there waiting to be in your life.
</P>
<P>
8. Happiness is an inside job

Happiness is never controlled by the things around you, instead what you yourself create. Your happiness is no one else's business.
</P>
<P>
9. Everyone is going through something

As humans, we tend to focus a lot on what we are going through personally and we forget that everyone around us is going through something too. I always try to remember in times of hardship that if everyone threw their problems into a pile I would probably take mine back instantly.
</P>
<P>
10. Life is short… buy it

Does this even need an explanation?
</P>
<P>
11. Crying is okay

Cry as hard as you need to, but when you're done stand up, wash your face and move on.
</P>
<P>
12. Your parents are almost always right

I can already hear my parents giving me a hard time for this one, and more "I told you so" than I have already heard this year. Anytime I asked for their advice or opinion they ended up being right… and luckily enough they are always there for you too.
</P>
<P>
13. Writing helps everything

I started writing for the Odyssey but even in a journal, notebook or post can help you express feelings. Writing makes sense when other things do not.
</P>
<P>
14. Your mental health is important

Take care of yourself and how you feel. Your feelings and emotions are not wrong.
</P>
<P>
15. Live every day differently

Do not live the same day 100 times and call it a life. Go out and do new things.
</P>
<P>
16. Saying no is okay

And believe it or not, no, is a complete sentence. You owe no one an explanation.
</P>
<P>
17. Do not yuck someones yum

This goes for food and for life, if someone likes it you have no right to tell them they should not. Unless it is bad.. then you have every right.
</P>
<P>
18. The sun will rise and you can try again

Today did not have to be the day, there is tomorrow, prepare for tomorrow and have hope. You got this.
</P>
