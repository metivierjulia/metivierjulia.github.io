    I always wrote for fun, I would constantly write my friends letters or something just in the notes on my phone. Finally I found some place where my writings could be shared publically. I applied and got accepted to an organization in which we write articles weekly about topics of our choosing.
    My most popular article in which I have written is one about my advice to a second sememster high school senior, in which it has been viewed over 80,000 times, and shared publically over 2,000 times.

    Below are three of the articles in which I have written! Enjoy!!
