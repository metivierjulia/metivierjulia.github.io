    <header> TO MY DIVORCE PARENTS, THANK YOU </header>

    To My Divorced Parents,

    Thank You

    Coming into college I met a lot of people with divorced parents. I realized very quickly that every divorce was not as easy on the kid as you made yours be. Here is the thank you that you both deserve for coparenting in a way that some will never see.

    First and foremost, thank you for never putting your issues on me. Through my entire childhood, I cannot recall a time where I watched you two argue. You never put your relationship problems on me and because of that, I got to grow up as a kid should. I was never scared to come home to arguing or fights because that never happened.

    You forever kept your love for me the same it had always been.

    Second, thank you for attending all my events. Yes, I know this was an effort put in by each of you individually but from the soccer games to many school concerts you two attended, you both encouraged me and both showed up. Half the time I walked to the sideline or lobby and you two were talking and laughing. That made me realize that you both understood you each were valuable parts of my life and despite the divorce that was not going to change. I have never told you this but when you guys sat together at my graduation and cried together and we're proud of me together, that meant more to me than you will ever know.

    Lastly, thank you for coparenting the way you did in general. This is a very broad term - coparenting. But if a book is written on this you two should be the authors. From bills to holidays to simple things such as the first day of school pictures you two kept the communication strong for me. I appreciate how you two looked at the bigger picture and understood that I did not need separate entities but instead one unit. You did not have to be one unit under the law, but in my eyes you both always were.


    I love you both so incredibly much for what you did for me. You showed me that sometimes people cannot be married or living under the same roof but can still put their problems and differences aside and see the bigger picture.

    Love,

    The daughter who should have told you this a long time ago
