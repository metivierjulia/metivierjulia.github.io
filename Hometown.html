In 2001 my parents packed up their stuff from a small town in Connecticut and moved to a small town in Massachusetts. They found a house in Foxboro Massachusetts (home of The New England Patriots) and there we stayed.

    Foxboro Massachusetts is a small town that is part of Norfolk County. The small town is about 22 miles Southwest of Boston, 18 miles Northeast of Providence, Rhode Island and about 73 miles Northwest of Cape Cod. The population is about 17,574 people as of 2017 and continuously grows due to young families and new families finding Foxboro and creating their forever home.

Gillete stadium came a little later than the town. In March of 2000 Gillette Stadium was built. Home of The New England Patriots. The 66,829 person stadium is also home to The New England Revolution and The University of Massachusetts Amherst football team.

    Growing up in Foxboro has been an interesting ride for sure. The idea that one of the most famous, and one of the most successful teams in NFL history is in my backyard has always mind boggled me. One thing that does get pretty frustrating is the traffic. You learn very quiclkly when to run your Sunday errands, or what roads you drive down or which ones the cops are at the end. You learn very quickly that the town is someplace that people visit on a family vacation or want to travel to instead of another place. Not everyone can say their town is a landmark.
