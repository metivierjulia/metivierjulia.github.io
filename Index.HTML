<P> <b> Hey! Welcome to my web page.</b> I am a first year student here at the University of Maine. I am from Foxboro Massachusetts. I am a business marketing major with an economics minor, and soon I will most likely be adding another minor of graphic design.

<P>
  On this page I have included links to a couple different things. One of my links is to my photography, that link includes many picture in which I have taken myself over the past couple years. Another one of my links includes information about where I am from (Foxboro Massachusetts), and the final link includes some articles I have written for the website "Odyssey". The Odyssey is an online article platform in which I write an article a week and it is shared all over the internet (Facebook, Instagram, and The Odyssey.com).
